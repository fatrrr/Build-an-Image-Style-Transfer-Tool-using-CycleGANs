# Transform Photos to Monet Paintings with CycleGANs

Artists like Claude Monet are recognized for the unique styles of their works, such as the unique colour scheme and brush strokes. These are hard to be imitated by normal people, and even for professional painters, it will not be easy to produce a painting whose style is Monet-esque. However, thanks to the invention of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their many variations, Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers can build and train deep learning models to bring an artist's peculiar style to your photos.

In this project, you will be guided through building a style transfer tool using CycleGAN to "translate" the photos in your album into paintings that are Monet-esque!
